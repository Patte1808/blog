Hi there,

this is my first blog post ever written. 

#### Who am I?
My name is Patrick Vo√ü. I'm a computer science student at the Humboldt-University in Berlin.

#### What am I currently doing?
Previously I worked as a web developer, where I worked with Django. 
I just quit my job. I had amazing collegues, learned a lot and had a very good time.
The decision to quit my job was a tough one.

There's also this one app I'm using extensivly. It's called Jodel.
If I had to describe it in one sentence I would say it's like Twitter, but you're only seeing posts from people near your current location. 
(Remember: I'm a computer scientist, I don't have any experience in marketing :D)

If Jodel karma every becomes a cryptocurrency, I'll be a very rich man - but one doesn't talk about karma.

I had some really amazing and funny experiences using Jodel. 
I met people in my neighborhood and went with them to the gym. 
I also used it while traveling in Indonesia, where I met some awesome people which I would've never met or talked to without Jodel.
I know people who have met their partner using Jodel.
Some of my friends have built up a circle of real friends using Jodel. 
There was even an embarrassing situation - which in retrospect was very funny - in the train where another Jodler was sitting in front of me. I won't go into detail. You can ask me personally if we ever meet.

As you can see I'm really excited about Jodel.

#### Why am I talking about Jodel?
A few months ago I applied for a job there and had a nice interview with the CTO who thought that I would fit into the Android team. I didn't have any Android experience at this moment, just some with Java. My first task was a [coding challenge](https://github.com/Jodel/Jodel-Android-Challenge) and I immediately started working on it. Don't get me wrong - I already had some experience in programming, but having to work with dependency injection, reactive programming etc. was a whole new experience. The task alone wasn't difficult, but having to work with new concepts etc. is kinda overwhelming. I learned a lot during this coding challenge.

After a few more interviews I got the job.

I'm really excited about it. I think I started using Jodel 2 years ago and now I've the opportunity to work with them.

#### What is this blog about?
This blog is more about my own learning progress rather than giving best practices.
I'm not expecting anyone to read my blog, but if you do I would be glad if you give me feedback or correct me.
I'm always happy to learn from someone with more experience and I think making mistakes and discover them is a huge boost in my personal learning progress.

I also want to blog about my work at Jodel, but as I'll just have my first day, I'm not sure whether I'm allowed to blog about it.
